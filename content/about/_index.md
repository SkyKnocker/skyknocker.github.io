### 🎯 Current Mission

* **Network Hardening:** Learning to secure systems before the "bad actors" arrive.
* **Ethical Hacking:** Understanding the attacker's mindset to build better defenses.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), macOS, Windows.
* **Tools:** Nmap, Wireshark, Git, Hugo.
* **Interests:** Threat Hunting, OSINT, and DevSecOps.
